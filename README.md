## Overview
The Titanic dataset, widely available on Kaggle, includes details of passengers aboard the Titanic, such as their age, gender, fare, class, and whether they survived. This project aims to clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and then using visualizations to explore key patterns.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file?select=tested.csv)
- Description: This dataset includes various features of Titanic passengers such as:
  
   - `Age`: The age of the passenger.
   - `Fare`: The amount paid for the ticket.
   - `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
   - `Embarked`: Port of embarkation.
   - `Cabin`: Cabin number or unknown if missing.
   - `Survived`: Whether the passenger survived the incident.
